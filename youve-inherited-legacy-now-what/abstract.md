# You've inherited a legacy codebase... now what?

Congratulations! You're now the proud owner of someone else's legacy project. What follows is simple: all you need to
do is keep your newest bundle of joy from catching fire and dying a painful (and costly!) death.

Simple, right?

Unfortunately, we all know it's not that easy in practice. Navigating an unfamiliar codebase is difficult at the best
of times, but if that codebase hasn't been maintained in 10 years and wasn't brilliant to begin with, you're in for a
challenge.

However, with the right approach, you can minimise the pain involved and help ensure that once you have things running,
it doesn't break catastrophically, and when things do break, you have an idea what to do. And with enough time and care,
you may even be able to transform your ugly duckling into a beautiful swan - or, at the very least, something you could
learn to love.

As much as the exact approach depends on many different factors, all existing codebases falling into new hands have a
few things in common. In this talk, I'll outline some of the general steps involved in successfully getting an existing
project you know nothing about into a manageable state, and preventing disasters with the software you're now responsible
for.
