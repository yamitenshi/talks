# Cryptography for mere mortals

Cryptography is one of those weird subjects, in that it is simultaneously really easy and really 
hard. We all use cryptography every day with next to no effort - whether we're hashing passwords 
or using HTTPS, cryptography is an integral part of what we do. When applying cryptography to our 
own code, we know not to roll our own, and to use readily made solutions. We also know to keep 
the private keys private and the secrets secret so the whole thing works as we intend it to. But 
do we really understand what we're doing and why we're doing it?

This talk aims to explain what cryptography is and does, where we apply it, where we should apply 
it, and some of the concerns that arise in doing so. It will do this in a little less detail and a 
little more practicality. Expect to hear about data at rest vs data in transit, symmetric vs 
asymmetric cryptography and why to use one over the other, why it's so important that we never ever 
ever roll our own crypto, and what kinds of mistakes we can make even when we don't.
